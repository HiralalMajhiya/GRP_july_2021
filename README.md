# GRP_july_2021

Hi There!, In this project I would be working on a simple regresson problem in which i have to predict the percentage of the student based on 
how much time he/she devotes towards study.
I would use some build in function such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy,matplotlib  for this project.

Taks: Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

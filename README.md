# GRP_july_2021

Hi There!, In this project i would be working on a simple regresson problem in which i have to predict the percent a person would get bases on 
how much time he/she devotes towards study.
I would use some build in function such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy,matplotlib  for this project.
